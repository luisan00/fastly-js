# fastly-lib
Node.js client to interface with the API Fastly

### Installing
The simplest method is to use npm in your source code folder
```bash
npm install fastly-lib
```
Or if you want to add it in your package.json, type:
```bash
npm install fastly-lib --save
```
### Firstly and before to use the client, I strongly recommend reading the documentation about the <a target="_blank"  href="https://docs.fastly.com/api/">API Fastly</a>
